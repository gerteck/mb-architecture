# How does MarkBind Work

I thought that MarkBind's Architecture page was helpful, but left me wanting more! So I decided to sweep the codebase and see what's up. 

* [MarkBind Dev Guide](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/devGuide.html)
* [MarkBind Architecture Page](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/design/architecture.html)

It helped me to understand more about how MarkBind works. So, here are some diagrams to better understand the flow of MarkBind.

This site was based on MarkBind 5.5.3, and may not be updated entirely. Diagrams shown here may not be 100% accurate! Feel free to clone it and make your own changes, or just open a PR! Will merge it if you do!

Cheers! You can read it as a bedtime story (since you might fall asleep).
