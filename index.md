# Hello There

I thought that MarkBind's architecture page wasn't comprehensive enough. 

* [MarkBind Dev Guide](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/devGuide.html)
* [MarkBind Architecture Page](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/design/architecture.html)

So I thought I should do a bit more to understand how MarkBind works. So, here are some diagrams to better understand the flow of MarkBind.

However, I hold no claims over the 100% accuracy of the diagrams shown here.

Cheers! You can read it as a bedtime story instead of scrolling brainrot.
