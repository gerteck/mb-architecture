# MarkBind Site

The `Site` class is initialized with configuration details (either default or user-specified) and is responsible for tasks such as generating the static site, handling page rendering, and deploying the built site to a GitHub repository. Each command in the CLI interacts with the `Site` instance to trigger the appropriate actions, whether it's starting a local server, building the site for deployment, or directly deploying the site to GitHub Pages.
